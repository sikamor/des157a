        Forms, and Designing for the User
    </h1>
<article>
    <p>
        Designing forms for the web is one of the most important tasks of a designer because not only are they the most common uses of the medium but users generally are adverse to using them. This creates an interesting challenge where a designer has to make the form as approachable as possible.
    <br><br>
        <em>Some principles must be taken note:</em>
    <br><br>
        Single column forms are the best approach. Anything more will confuse the order for the user
    <br><br>
        Input fields are important as well. If there are more than an approachable number of fields, they should be condensed into 5 to 7. 
    <br><br>
        Avoid setting default values, because it introduces the error of users overlooking it. Unless there is certainty that 90% of the users are going to have the answer, it is best practice to not use any default values.
    <br><br>
        Using input masks can make the form feel more cooperative for users; simple details like automatic parentheses and hyphens in a phone number input makes the user feel like they are doing less work themselves.
