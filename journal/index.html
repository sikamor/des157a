        Challenges of implementing a Modal Window
    </h2>
    <p>
        Modals windows, or pop-up screens, interupt the user's experience and therefor create an issue with site retention. However, modal windows are still used in some instances such as getting user input like a login or expanding on the content on the page.
        <br><br>
        <em>These design principles are important:</em>
        <br><br>
        Modals need a clear escape route, so the user doesn't feel trapped.
        <br><br>
        These windows also need a title so it is clear to the users where they are. Otherwise it can be disorienting or misleading.
        <br><br>
        Best design practices for modals are placement in the upper half of the viewing screen and not more than 50% of the actual screen width.
        <br><br>
        Finally, modals should be initiated by the user only. Pop-ups are always displeasuring for the user and will likely ruin the intended task.
        <br><br>
        For accesibility and cohesiveness, the keyboard should be able to function the initiation and closing sequence of the modal as well as automatically switch from the main page to the modal.
        <br><br>
        Consider the necessity of a modal before implementing one. They are unpopular with users, but they can simplify a site's UI and emphasize a certain task. Understanding the design and usabilty concepts helps a designer gauge the necessity and usability.

        Forms, and Designing for the User
    </h2>
    <p>
        Designing forms for the web is one of the most important tasks of a designer because not only are they the most common uses of the medium but users generally are adverse to using them. This creates an interesting challenge where a designer has to make the form as approachable as possible.
    <br><br>
        <em>Some principles must be taken note:</em>
    <br><br>
        Single column forms are the best approach. Anything more will confuse the order for the user
    <br><br>
        Input fields are important as well. If there are more than an approachable number of fields, they should be condensed into 5 to 7. 
    <br><br>
        Avoid setting default values, because it introduces the error of users overlooking it. Unless there is certainty that 90% of the users are going to have the answer, it is best practice to not use any default values.
    <br><br>
        Using input masks can make the form feel more cooperative for users; simple details like automatic parentheses and hyphens in a phone number input makes the user feel like they are doing less work themselves.
